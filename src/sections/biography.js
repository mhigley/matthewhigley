            In 2008, I completed a certification course at Fresno Institute of
            Technology for web and graphic design. It wasn't much, but it got my
            foot in the door for a fantastic journey yet to come. Right out of
            school I spent eight months as an intern for{" "}
            <a href="http://bit.ly/1MJ1irL" target="_blank">
              Hundred10 Design
            </a>
            , and it was during this time that I truly began learning the ropes
            of front-end development. They brought me on full-time as a junior
            developer and spent two years learning from the best. From there, I
            joined the marketing team at{" "}
            <a href="http://bit.ly/1I9hgoP" target="_blank">
              Paprika Studios
            </a>{" "}
            where I developed with PHP and Drupal and added video to my skill
            set with the help of{" "}
            <a href="http://bit.ly/1KI5aF4" target="_blank">
              Meza Films
            </a>
            . I later found a place with{" "}

            </a>{" "}
            and the Buildicus development team. It was there that I was
            encouraged into exploring teaching and had the honor of developing
            Geekwise Academy's Bootcamp 2 course, spending 13 rounds sharing my
            knowledge with hundreds of students coming through the program. I'm
            now a full-time Developer Fellow for{" "}
            <a href="http://bit.ly/1JtLxzv" target="_blank">
              Bitwise Industries
            </a>{" "}
            having taught two six-month courses of a specialized class for
            individuals in partnership with the Fresno DSS and EDC, a semester
            at the brand new high school Patiño School of Entrepreneurship and
            recently adding an introduction to Javascript course to my resumé.
